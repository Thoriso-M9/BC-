My name is Darryl Mokwele, and here are fun facts you should know about me:

- I take part in game jams, where I mix fun, pressure, and creativity into awesome little games.
- I was a prefect and class rep in both Grade 11 and 12 , leadership is in my DNA.
- I love drawing and writing, especially when I need a break from the code.
- I'm always up for learning something new and leveling up my skills.
- I juggle classes from 1 to 5 p.m., Monday to Friday , and still make time to do what I love.
